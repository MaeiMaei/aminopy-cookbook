Can we get banned using Amino.py?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Depends**, 
Amino doesn't have any specific rules against it, but I've used it for many months and never got punished, if you don't go againts the amino guidelines and the community guidelines, nothing will happen to you. 

But keep in mind that if your account does get disabled and you get device banned, we won't be responsible for it.



My code doesn't work and doesn't show anything
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Print the code,

| When this happens it means that something is blocking you from executing that command or you messed your code somewhere, to check, print the faulty code. 
| 
| Simple example below

.. code-block:: python

    code = client.sub_clients  
    print(code)



My code is returning the error json.decoder.JSONDecodeError
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Issue from Amino,

Amino sometimes due to the servers being trash, it doesn't return anything instead of json, that happens because the library expects json but gets nothing. 

For this you can just ignore it with an try except. Simple example below

.. code-block:: python

   import json

   try:
      client.sub_clients
   except json.decoder.JSONDecodeError:
      pass

How do I use objects?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For example, if you do subclient.get_chat_members() you'll get UserProfileList(), and for example if you want to get their nickname, you should add .nickname and there you have it.
