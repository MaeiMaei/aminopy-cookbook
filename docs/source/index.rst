Welcome to the Amino.py Cookbook!
=============================================

.. note:: I'm slowly taking out the cookbook out hibernation again, might put it back to sleep if something bad happens.


I lied to you! This isn't a cookbook, it's more or less a reference manual. These are just some snippets I often come back to.
I'm by no means an expert, this repo is free for contribution. 

Take a look at the CONTRIBUTING.md and enjoy!

Oh yeah, if you find this boring and are disappointed, have a bunch of opossums eating bananas as sorry.
